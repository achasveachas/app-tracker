## App Tracker API

### Overview

This is an API for a job tracking application I created (can be found [here](https://app-tracker-react.herokuapp.com/), GitHub repo can be found [here](https://github.com/achasveachas/app-tracker-react)), where job applicants can keep track of the different applications they've submitted, and the various actions they've taken in regards to said applications (e-mails, communications, meetings, interviews, etc.)

### Technical Specs

The API was built using Rails V. 5.0.2

It uses a PostgreSQL database.

The test suite was built using [RSpec](http://rspec.info/about/).
